# Mining-dense-subgraph
This project implements a recursive algorithm to mine subgraphs from a connected graph based on their relative density (a parameter that needs to be defined).

The main program is Quick.m, which is a function that takes a graph and a density paramter and a minimum-size paramter.
This is an algorithm to mine maximal gamma-quasi cliques from a connected graph.
